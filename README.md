# **Autoencoder for MNIST Dataset**

A custom-built autoencoder designed to learn latent representations and reconstruct MNIST handwritten digit images using NumPy and Python. This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple deep learning model from scratch, including forward propagation, backpropagation, and visualization of results.

---

## **Features**
- Implementation of a **6-layer neural network**:
  - **Encoder:** 784 → 512 → 256 → 128
  - **Decoder:** 128 → 256 → 512 → 784
- **Mini-batch gradient descent** for efficient training.
- Custom loss computation using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- Visualization of:
  - **Loss curve** over training epochs.
  - **Latent space** using PCA.
  - Original vs. reconstructed images.
- Training progress with a final **loss of 0.0040** after 100 epochs.

## **Setup Instructions**
### **Prerequisites**
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.6 or above
- NumPy
- matplotlib
- TorchVision
- scikit-learn

### **Installation**
Clone this repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Autoencoder-MNIST.git
cd Autoencoder-MNIST
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## **Usage**
### **Running the Code**
To execute the script, use the following command:
```bash
python autoencoder_mnist.py
```

### **Outputs**
- The script will generate the following outputs:
  - **Loss Curve:** A graph showing the model’s loss during training.
  - **Latent Space Visualization:** A scatter plot of latent codes reduced using PCA.
  - **Reconstructed Images:** A side-by-side comparison of original and reconstructed images.

---

## **Results**
### **Loss Curve**
The model achieved a final Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss of **0.0040** after 100 epochs of training:

## **How It Works**
1. **Encoder:** Compresses the 784-dimensional input data (28x28 images) into a 128-dimensional latent representation.
2. **Decoder:** Reconstructs the original input data from the latent representation.
3. **Training:** Uses mini-batch gradient descent and Mean Squared Error (MSE) to optimize the weights and biases.
4. **Visualization:** PCA reduces the 128-dimensional latent codes to 2D for easy visualization.

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python:** Core programming language for implementation.
- **NumPy:** Efficient matrix operations.
- **TorchVision:** For MNIST dataset preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib:** Visualization of results.
- **scikit-learn:** PCA for latent space analysis.
